Hi, welcome to my page.

I'm a mature coding newbie, having completed SQA Level 5 NPA Web Design and Software Development CR2WDSJC21-S1SA in June 2022.

As at August 2022 I am undertaking: 
(1) CodeSpace - Induction CR1CSICZ22-X1XA, and 
(2) NPA Software Development and Digital Design CR1DM6DC22-F1GA

While I am still a novice, I'm very happy to help out where I can.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance.

Best wishes

TD
